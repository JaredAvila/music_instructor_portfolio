                        <p>I began playing the saxophone in 8th grade. In high school I was 1st chair alto in Symphonic Band and Jazz Ensemble. While still in school, formed and played in a jazz quartet that won the Unanimous Superior award at the California State High School Music Competition. After high school, I played Lead Alto and 1st Tenor saxophone in the West Valley College Jazz Ensemble over a 4 year period. Also played flute, alto and soprano saxophones with the jazz, latin fusion band Zamar for twelve years (comprised of 7 professional level musicians). Also was the music leader of the music departments for 3 different churches in the Santa Clara Valley over a 12 year period.</p>

                    <p>Whether the student is a beginner or a more advanced player, musical skills and technique must be built on a <span class="grey-text text-darken-4 bold">“solid foundation”</span> to achieve musical mastery in every technical aspect and at every playing level.</p>
                    <p>A true beginner will first learn how to properly hold the instrument, how to breath from the diaphragm, develop good embouchure (correct mouth position to the mouthpiece and reed) and how to produce a good and controlled sound from the instrument. This will insure the beginning student will not become frustrated in the critical early stages of learning to play an instrument, especially while the student is still developing the belief that they can actually become a good musician.</p>
                    <p>Students who are at various other stages of playing ability are assessed as to what areas need correction and improvement to create that <span class="grey-text text-darken-4 bold">“solid foundation”</span>. Each student will have their own lesson plan tailored to fit their needs and skill  level.</p>
                    <p>Just as a house that is built on a <span class="grey-text text-darken-4 bold">“solid foundation”</span> will not develop sagging floors and cracking walls, so the student’s playing technique will not develop poor tone production, erratic cadence and other technical problems with the careful and proper development of the skills of saxophone playing. </p>
                    <p><span class="grey-text text-darken-4 bold">“Solid Foundation”</span> teaching methodology is built on the following:</p>
                    <ul class="center black-text">
                        <li>Breathing development and technique</li>
                        <li>Embouchure development</li>
                        <li>Basic instrument playing knowledge</li>
                        <li>Preparation and warm up for practice, lessons and performance</li>
                        <li>Utilizing the most accepted and recommended musical study material</li>
                        <li>Development of smooth and even meter with use of a metronome</li>
                        <li>Progressive approach to increasing skill an musical ability</li>
                        <li>Specific focus on mastering each students unique technical challenges</li>
                        <li>Learning basic and relational music theory</li>
                        <li>Periodic measurement of students progress</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This <span class="grey-text text-darken-4 bold">“solid foundation”</span> approach will facilitate much swifter development of the students playing ability as well as increasing their enjoyment and love for their instrument and of music in general.</p>

                <p>I remember the first time I heard the statement "Did you know that listening to classical music enhances your mathematical abilities?" I was both intrigued and excited, intrigued because I did not understand how music and math, two seemingly unrelated subject could possibly affect each other. I was also excited because I began to view classical music as some kind of magical potion that would transform my math skills from decent to extraordinary. When I had the opportunity to write this web paper, I immediately jumped into the topic of music and math. The questions that I wish to answer throughout this paper are; does listening to music really help you do better in math? If so, which part of the brain is controlling the correlation between math and music? In addition, how does music stimulate the brain in a way that enhances mathematical abilities?
                  It turns out that there is much evidence that supports the positive effects of music on one's ability to do math. Most research shows that when children are trained in music at a young age, they tend to improve in their math skills. The surprising thing in this research is not that music as a whole is enhancing math skills. It is certain aspects of music that are affecting mathematics ability in a big way. Studies done mostly in children of young age show that their academic performance increases after a certain period of music education and training. One particular study published in the journal 'Nature' showed that when groups of first graders were given music instruction that emphasized sequential skill development and musical games involving rhythmn and pitch, after six months, the students scored significantly better in math than students in groups that received traditional music instruction.<br><br>
                  ​
                  The result of this study posed another important question. How does this type of music that emphasized sequential skills, rhythmn and pitch manage to improve children's ability to do math? It turned out that there are two distinguished types of reasoning, spatial temporal (ST) reasoning and Language analytical (LA) reasoning. LA reasoning would be involved in solving equations and obtaining a quantitative result. ST reasoning would be is utilized in activities like chess when one needs to think ahead several moves. The effect of music on math sometimes termed the Mozart effect. The Mozart effect gain its name after the discovery that listening to Mozart's compositions, which is very sequential, produces a short-termed enhancement of spatial-temporal reasoning. Some key reasoning features used in spatial temporal reasoning are<br>
                  1. The transformation and relating of mental images in space and time
                  2. Symmetries of the inherent cortical firing patterns used to compare physical and mental images and 
                  3. Natural temporal sequences of those inherent cortical patterns.</p>
